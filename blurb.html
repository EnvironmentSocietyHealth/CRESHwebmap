<p>In Scotland, smoking and alcohol are two of the most important preventable causes of ill-health and premature death: one in every five deaths is attributable to tobacco and one in 20 to alcohol. The neighbourhood availability of tobacco and alcohol products has been implicated in promoting smoking and drinking behaviours. In CRESH we’ve been investigating the links between tobacco and alcohol environments and health (see <a href="https://cresh.org.uk/2014/10/07/alcohol-related-health-is-worse-in-scottish-neighbourhoods-with-more-alcohol-outlets/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://cresh.org.uk/2014/11/05/an-environment-where-young-people-choose-not-to-smoke-is-not-one-where-tobacco-products-are-sold-on-every-street-corner/" target="_blank">here</a> for more details). In partnership with <a href="http://www.alcohol-focus-scotland.org.uk/" target="_blank">Alcohol Focus Scotland</a> (AFS) and <a href="http://www.ashscotland.org.uk/" target="_blank">Action on Smoking and HealthScotland</a> (ASH Scotland) we’ve been funded by the <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Economic and Social Research Council</a> (ESRC) to publicise our research and make it more accessible to the public and policy makers. In 2015, this enabled us to create a <a href="http://kecoviewer.com/cresh/" target="_blank">webmap and data download facility</a>, as well as some eye-catching infographics for <a href="https://cresh.org.uk/2015/03/18/smoking-and-health-in-scotland-key-stats/" target="_blank">smoking</a>and <a href="https://cresh.org.uk/2015/06/03/alcohol-and-health-in-scotland-key-stats/" target="_blank">alcohol</a>.</p>
