Precursor- you have set up both computers to talk to github repository
Precursor- you have set PuTTY to login to remote computer

On your computer

## Make changes the files ( I like brackets)

go to directory with files
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Create a useful message"
git push origin master

now got to the remote computer terminal through putty

go to the same directory of files, should be in:
/srv/shiny-server

git status
git pull origin master
markocherrie, **input normal pass but slightly diff ;) **

now you want to copy the files to the nginx server

/usr/share/nginx
