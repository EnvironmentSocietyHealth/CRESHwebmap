Precursor- you have set up both computers to talk to github repository
Precursor- you have set PuTTY to login to remote computer

On your computer

## Make changes to app (Rstudio)
## Make changes to the web pages (Brackets)
## Make changes to the images (GIMP)

go to directory with files
/c/Users/mcherrie/Google Drive/ProjectFiles/CRESHwebmap/alcoholtobacco
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Create a useful message"
git push origin master

now got to the remote computer terminal through putty

go to the same directory of files, should be in:
/srv/shiny-server

git status
git pull origin master
markocherrie, **input normal pass but slightly diff ;) **

### if you have changed the images or html file then

now you want to copy the files to the nginx server (/usr/share/nginx/html)

so you copy images by running:
cp -R images /usr/share/nginx/html

and the html by running:
cd alcoholtobacco
cp index.html /usr/share/nginx/html 

Now restart the nginx server for the changes to take effect:
sudo service nginx stop
sudo service nginx start
sudo service nginx restart
